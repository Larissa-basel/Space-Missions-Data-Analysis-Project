**Space Mission Data Analysis**

This project explores space missions through end-to-end data analysis, from database design to dashboard visualization.
We built a complete pipeline: data generation, cleaning, SQL queries, and interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, and Streamlit.

Features:

- Database Design: ERD schema for agencies, missions, spacecraft, astronauts, and mission crews.

- Data Generation & Cleaning: Python (Faker + Pandas) with logical rules for realistic data.

- SQL Analysis: KPIs (longest mission, most frequent spacecraft, astronaut stats, etc.).

Dashboards:

- Excel → Astronaut demographics and mission insights.

- Power BI → Agencies, missions, spacecraft, and astronaut dashboards.

- Streamlit (Plotly Express) → Interactive, filterable exploration of missions.

Tech Stack:

- Languages & Tools: Python, SQL Server, Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit

- Visualization: Excel, Power BI, Streamlit

- Libraries: Faker, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas
